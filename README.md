  ## Description <a name='description'></a>
  This project was built to test the backend of a ecommerce website and navigate between different routes. We were able to run and test on how to add, edit and delete user requests while seeing it real time. 

  ## Installation <a name='installation'></a>
  Ensure you have node installed into your project and the following packages installed: dotenv, express, mysql2 and sequelize. In the video demonstration, I was using Insomnia to test all of our routes.

  ## Usage <a name='usage'></a>
  This application allows the user to browse an online marketplace what is currently listed and able to edit current listings. Watch the video below!
